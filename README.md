# Anime Suggestionizer


My Anime Suggestionizer tool is designed to help users discover trending anime based on their selected year and season. Initially developed with a traditional Tkinter GUI, the project has been upgraded to use CustomTkinter for an enhanced user interface experience. The tool fetches data from the AniList GraphQL API, presenting the top 50 trending anime for the user's chosen time frame. Users can delete shows they've already watched from the list and reroll for a new random suggestion at any time.

This project can be cloned and ran via terminal, or you can simply download the packaged files and run the executable to use my tool.
## Features

- Year and Season Selection: Users can specify the year and season to fetch the top 50 trending anime titles.
- Random Anime Suggestion: Based on the selected criteria, the tool suggests a random anime to watch.
- Delete Watched Shows: Users can remove anime they've already seen from the list.
- Reroll Suggestion: Users can request a new suggestion without changing the initial criteria.
- Enhanced UI with CustomTkinter: An upgraded user interface utilizing CustomTkinter for a more modern look and feel.
